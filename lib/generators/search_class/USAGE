Description:
    This generator creates a basic search_class skeleton with basic method templates
    and a test file to test the search class

Example:
    rails generate search_class file_name

    This will create:
        app/models/custom_connectors/file_name_search_class.rb => basic search class skeleton
        spec/models/connectors/file_name_spec.rb => spec (test on SearchCollection)
